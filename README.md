# Fun-fact ðŸ‘‹

# The first computer virus was created in 1986

Given the moniker Brain, the virus was created by two brothers, Basit and Amjad Farooq Alvi, in Pakistan. According to the siblings, who ran a popular computer store, they created Brain to stop their customers from making copies of their software without permission.

However, unlike traditional viruses, Brain only contained a hidden copyright message and did not corrupt or delete any of the userâ€™s files or information.
